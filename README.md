Purpose

The purpose of this portfolio is to develop a site that can be used as the basis for a potfolio that could be shown to
prospective employers. The idea is that t is an opportunity to intrduce oneself, whilst also show casing skills, knowledge and abilities through project demostrations.

Functionality / features

This project includes a simple design where I have attempted to keep pages simle and uncluttered. The colour schema has been inspired by profesional sites such as ALIBABA.

Across all four pages the same basic HTML structure has been used i.e nav bar, section 1, section 2 and a footer. This allows the re-use of much of the code.

Challenges

I have used a hamburger menu in the responsive design. At forst I was able to make this work without hiccup. I have now noticed that after changing the styling. it will no longer work, whilst the hamburger appears, the menu will not drop down. i do not know why.

Initilly the styling was challenging in regard to making a visually appealing site, as my sense of design is under developed. having researched other designs, I think I have made appropriate changes.

This site include four seperate HTML pages, each one displaying relvant information. They nclude:

1 Home Page

The home page includes a navbar with links to the other pages. Of particular note is the project section that includes 4 different cards that can be used to navigate to an external codepen site with examples of different projects, each requireing a different skill set to produce.

2 The About Me page

This is a simple page that includes a navigation bar from where the user can navigate t the other pages. This page has a simple layout with a headshot and some basic personal information. Above this is a link whereby the user can download a copy of my CV with more detailed information.

3 The Blog page

The blog page design is similar to the home page design in which a card system is utilised, and where it is intened that each card represents a different blog. It is intended here that each card would link to an external site.

4 The Conact page

The contact page includes simple contact information such as email, address and mobile number. To the right of this is a message form that ordinarily would allow the user to write a message and send direct to my emal address.
